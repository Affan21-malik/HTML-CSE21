A long motivational speech should start with a hook, share a relatable story or a powerful message about overcoming fear and embracing potential, and end with a call to action. It should encourage a focus on personal growth by breaking down large goals into smaller, manageable steps, while also emphasizing resilience, the value of experience, and the importance of an internal locus of control. A speech can also include a powerful, personal anecdote that illustrates how to bounce back from failure and adversity. 
Introduction (Hook)
Engage the audience: Start with a strong opening, like a powerful quote or a short story, to capture attention.
Example: "Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond our measure," this quote from Professional Leadership Institute says. 
Core Message (Overcoming Challenges)
Embrace discomfort: Acknowledge that challenges and discomfort are signs of growth, not failure.
Break down goals: Explain that big achievements are the result of consistent, small actions over time.
Example: A long journey is completed one step at a time. Think of a large goal as a mountain. You don’t climb it in a single leap; you climb it by taking one step after another, celebrating each small victory along the way. </p>
